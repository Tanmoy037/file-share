**Defining what our file-sharing application should do**
1. Upload Files: Allow users to upload files.
2. Download Files: Allow users to download files via a link.
3. Manage Files: Optionally allow users to delete or view files they've uploaded.
4. Security: Implement authentication, authorization, and secure file handling.
5. Scalability: Design to handle many concurrent users
